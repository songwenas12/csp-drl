// two problems. This works as follow:
// - The first variables of mapping_model are in one to one correspondence with
//   the variables of the initial model.
// - The presolved_model variables are in one to one correspondence with the
//   variable at the indices given by postsolve_mapping in the mapping model.
// - Fixing one of the two sets of variables and solving the model will assign
//   the other set to a feasible solution of the other problem. Moreover, the
//   objective value of these solutions will be the same. Note that solving such
//   problems will take little time in practice because the propagation will
//   basically do all the work.
//
// Note(user): an optimization model can be transformed into a decision problem,
// if for instance the objective is fixed, or independent from the rest of the
// problem.
//
// TODO(user): Identify disconnected components and returns a vector of
// presolved model? If we go this route, it may be nicer to store the indices
// inside the model. We can add a IntegerVariableProto::initial_index;
