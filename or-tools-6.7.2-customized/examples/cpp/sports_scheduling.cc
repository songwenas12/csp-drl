// Sports scheduling problem.
//
// We want to solve the problem of scheduling of team matches in a
// double round robin tournament.  Given a number of teams, we want
// each team to encounter all other teams, twice, once at home, and
// once away. Furthermore, you cannot meet the same team twice in the
// same half-season.
//
// Finally, there are constraints on the sequence of home or aways:
//   - You cannot have 3 consecutive homes or three consecutive aways.
//   - A break is a sequence of two homes or two aways, the overall objective
//     of the optimization problem is to minimize the total number of breaks.
//
// We model this problem with three matrices of variables, each with
// num_teams rows and 2*(num_teams - 1) columns: the var [i][j]
// corresponds to the match of team #i at day #j. There are
// 2*(num_teams - 1) columns because each team meets num_teams - 1
// opponents twice.

// - The 'opponent' var [i][j] is the index of the opposing team.
// - The 'home_away' var [i][j] is a boolean: 1 for 'playing away',
//   0 for 'playing at home'.
// - The 'opponent_and_home_away' var [i][j] is the 'opponent' var [i][j] +
//   num_teams * the 'home_away' var [i][j].
// This aggregated variable will be useful to state constraints of the model
// and to do search on it.
//
// We use an original approch in this model as most of the constraints will
// be pre-computed and asserted using an AllowedAssignment constraint (see
// Solver::MakeAllowedAssignment() in constraint_solver.h).
// In particular:
//   - Each day, we have a perfect matching between teams
//     (A meets B <=> B meets A, and A is at home <=> B is away).
//     A cannot meet itself.
//   - For each team, over the length of the tournament, we have constraints
//     on the sequence of home-aways. We will precompute all possible sequences
//     of home_aways, as well as the corresponding number of breaks for that
//     team.
//   - For a given team and a given day, the link between the opponent var,
//     the home_away var and the aggregated var (see third matrix of variables)
//     is also maintained using a AllowedAssignment constraint.
//
// Usage: run this with --helpshort for a short usage manual.
